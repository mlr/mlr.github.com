title: About
---

I'm a software developer located in Portland, OR. I work
primarily in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).
I'm a firm believer in automated testing so I'm well versed in TDD tools, such as
[RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec). I also like to dabble in frontend
libraries and frameworks from time to time.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy climbing mountains and spending time in the cockpit
[learning to fly](http://www.kerncharter.com).

I am always looking for new opportunities.  [Let's talk](mailto:ronniemiller@gmail.com).
