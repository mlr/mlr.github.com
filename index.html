<p>
  I'm a software developer currently working primarily in <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I occasionally dabble in frontend libaries and frameworks.
  I'm a firm believer in automated testing, so I'm also well versed with popular TDD tools.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not writing code, I like climbing mountains and spending time in the cockpit
  <a href="http://www.kerncharter.com">learning to fly</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am always looking for new opportunities.
