<p>
  I'm a software developer currently working primarily in <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I'm a firm believer in automated testing so I'm well versed in TDD tools,
  such as <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a>. I also dabble in frontend libaries and frameworks from time to time.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not writing code, I enjoy climbing mountains and spending time in the cockpit
  <a href="http://www.kerncharter.com">learning to fly</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am always looking for new opportunities.
