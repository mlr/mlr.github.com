## Objective

Use my many years of web and software development experience to provide tools
and services to make people's lives easier.  I'm looking for a role that allows

and adapting the technical skills of myself and others through knowledge sharing,
pairing and other collaborative efforts.

## Work Experience

### Software Engineer - CrowdCompass by Cvent

#### January 2015 - Present

I work closely with our product, design, quality and operations teams to hash
out features that are both technically efficient and backward compatible, but
also provide a great experience for our users. I also help mentor other team
members and interns, participate in code reviews and provide feedback on
architectural decisions. Daily development stack includes a variety of Ruby
applications (mostly Rails), RSpec, PostgreSQL and a variety of AWS products.

Some notable things I have accomplished:

* Reduced infrastructure cost by migrating third-party dependencies to AWS equivalents
* Built REST microservices for custom email templating and delivery for our client's events
* Improved email delivery throughput by refactoring and improving delivery mechanisms

### Freelance Software Developer

#### May 2008 - December 2015

As a freelance software developer and consultant I am directly involved in every stage
of web and software products; from RFPs, to initial concepts, to information gathering,
to design, development, launch, and maintenance.

My typical tools include Ruby/Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL; however, I continually expand
my skill set to provide the best solutions for any given project. I have many years of
experience with PHP and its frameworks, so I leverage those tools when needed.

I'm also very skilled in front-end technologies: HTML5 & CSS3 including pixel perfect
PSD to markup conversion; JavaScript and many of its frameworks such as React and
jQuery, jQuery UI, and more.
