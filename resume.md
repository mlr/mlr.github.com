## About

I am a highly experienced software engineer and teacher-at-heart. I utilize over
a decade of programming knowledge and experience to create powerful web-based
software tools. My goal is to build great software with a talented team, to
learn and improve my craft and to share knowledge through pairing
and other collaboration.

As a freelance software developer and consultant I am directly involved in every stage
of web and software products; from RFPs, to initial concepts, to information gathering,
to design, development, launch, and maintenance.

My typical tools include Ruby/Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL; however, I continually expand
my skill set to provide the best solutions for any given project. I have many years of
experience with PHP and its frameworks, so I leverage those tools when needed.

I'm also very skilled in front-end technologies: HTML5 & CSS3 including pixel perfect
PSD to markup conversion; JavaScript and many of its frameworks such as React and
jQuery, jQuery UI, and more.
