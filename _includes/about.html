    <p>
      I'm a software developer living and working in Portland, OR. I work mostly
      with <a href="http://ruby-lang.org" title="Ruby Language">Ruby</a> and
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</a>, but I'm
      also skilled in frontend development. I enjoy hiking, snowboarding,
      flying airplanes and spending time with my wife and son. The content here
      is an assemblage of random topics that piqued my interest long enough to
      write about&mdash;mostly software related.
