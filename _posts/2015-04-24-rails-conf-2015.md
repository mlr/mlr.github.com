RailsConf 2015 was hosted in the towering downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
I was grateful to have been sent to attend this year thanks to my
[rather awesome employer](http://crowdcompass.com).

Rails 5 was a large topic of discussion during DHH's opening keynote.
A couple of the big feature announcements were Turbolinks 3 and Action Cable.
Despite my tongue-in-cheek post title, I'm actually looking forward to trying
both of these features.

Back when I built [WorksTiming](http://www.workstiming.com) I ended up keeping
Turbolinks enabled. For the mostly-static dashboards it uses on the backend, the
standard functionality provided by Rails 4.x works pretty great; the only caveat
being of course the DOM on ready listener issue which actually
[isn't that difficult to fix](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18770589).

I also settled on using [Pusher](http://pusher.com) to provide live updating
features using websockets. I've been on the lookout for a better alternative
since, with some [promising possibilities](https://github.com/websocket-rails/websocket-rails),
but having a websocket story integrated into the core of Rails is a welcome
addition.

Another great announcement in Rails 5 is the integration of the Rails API work
that's been happening to make a slimmer starting point for building API
only or JS heavy applications. Read more about this decision direct from
one who helped make it happen: [Santiago Pastorino: Rails API to be part of
Rails 5](http://wyeworks.com/blog/2015/4/20/rails-api-is-going-to-be-included-in-rails-5).

All in all I had a great time this week at the conference and look forward to
following the development of Rails 5. Check out the [keynote
