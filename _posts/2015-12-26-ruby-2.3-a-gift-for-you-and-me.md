title: Ruby 2.3 &ndash; A Gift for You and Me
---

It's beginning to feel like tradition &ndash;&ndash; for the [second year
now](http://ronniemlr.com/2014/12/25/trying-out-new-features-of-ruby-2.2/),
the Ruby core team has shipped a minor point update on Christmas Day.
This year gifting the world Ruby 2.3.

After reading up on this release, it feels more more like a major
point update, just for the sheer amount of work that must have been involved.
Part of the release seems to be [paving the way](https://wyeworks.com/blog/2015/12/1/immutable-strings-in-ruby-2-dot-3)
for [immutability in Ruby 3.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11473)
and a large chunk of the release provided new syntax and language features.

Let's take a look at a few of the new features.
I was most looking forward to both the `Hash#dig` and `Array#dig` methods.
The "safe navigation" operator was added, which apparently is a
[favorite of Matz](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/12/25/ruby-2-3-0-on-heroku-with-matz#do-you-have-any-favorite-features-coming-in-ruby-2-3).
Additionally, the [did_you_mean gem](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11252) is
now built into the language, a breakthrough for typo-driven-development of which
I am so fond.

## Install Ruby 2.3.0

Using [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) we can quickly
grab the latest version of ruby.

{% highlight bash %}
ruby-install -M https://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.3.0
{% endhighlight %}

Once that's done downloading and compiling, I like
[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) for switching to the new version.

{% highlight bash %}
chruby 2.3
{% endhighlight %}

## Hash#dig and Array#dig

Both of these methods are great if you're dealing with unwieldy data sets that you
may or may not have control over. Think complex API responses, legacy system interfaces,
etc. They allow you to safely traverse into the data structure without raising
an error if a single node in the lookup doesn't exist.

### `Hash#dig`

Given a hash that looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
data = {
  people: [
    {
      first_name: "Jamie",
      last_name: "Jackson",
      team: "Blue Squad",
      qualifications: [
        {
          skill: "Oil Change",
          type: "primary"
        },
        {
          skill: "Alignment",
          type: "advanced"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      first_name: "Jordan",
      last_name: "Jacobs",
      team: "Red Squad",
      qualifications: []
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The dig method allows you to pull out data or simply get `nil` if the piece
of data doesn't exist at the path you've "dug" to. For instance:

{% highlight ruby %}
data[:people][0][:qualifications][0][:skill]
# => Oil Change
data[:people][1][:qualifications][0][:skill]
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
# thrown since data[:people][1][:qualifications][0] is nil

data.dig(:people, 0, :qualifications, 0, :skill)
# => Oil Change
data.dig(:people, 1, :qualifications, 0, :skill)
# => nil
{% endhighlight %}

### `Array#dig`

The dig method for Array works similarly:

{% highlight ruby %}
data = [
  [10, [10, 4]],
  [15, [15, 3]],
  [20]
]

data[0][1][0]
# => 10
data[1][1][0]
# => 15
data[2][1][0]
# => NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

data.dig(0, 1, 0)
# => 10
data.dig(1, 1, 0)
# => 15
data.dig(2, 1, 0)
# => nil
{% endhighlight %}

## Safe Navigation Operator

This is something that I hope people will use sparingly since it seems like it
would be a smell otherwise. The "safe navigation" operator allows you to call
a method on a variable that might be nil. Other languages, such as C# and Swift,
have a similar feature.

In Ruby it looks like this: `&.`

{% highlight ruby %}
# assume nilly is nil because User was not found
nilly = User.find_by(username: "nilly")

# Before Ruby 2.3
nilly.notify!           # NoMethodError error because nilly is nil!
nilly && nilly.notify!  # avoid NoMethodError using short-circuit conditional

# After Ruby 2.3
nilly&.notify!          # will only call notify! if nilly is not nil
# => nil                # just returns nil when object is nil
{% endhighlight %}

I can see this coming in handy in some situations, but I would consider using a
[null object pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=null+object+pattern)
if I frequently found myself calling methods on something that is possibly nil.

## did_you_mean

The [did_you_mean gem](https://github.com/yuki24/did_you_mean) is a nice little
tool that provides helpful suggestions when you mispell or tpyo a word. It's
also nice when you might have a good idea of a method name, but need a
little help.

Check it out:

{% highlight ruby %}
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]

data.puhs(5)
# NoMethodError: undefined method `puhs' for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:Array
# Did you mean?  push
#                puts
data.push(5)

data.sliver(2,5)
# NoMethodError: undefined method `sliver' for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:Array
# Did you mean?  slice
#                slice!

data.slice(2,5)
# => [3, 4, 5]
{% endhighlight %}
